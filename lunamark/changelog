lunamark 0.3 (released 26 Oct 2012)

  * Removed title h1 tag in html template.

  * Made benchmarks easier to read.

  * A blockquote or header ends a paragraph.
    This makes lunamark more compatible with other implementations,
    even though I'm dubious whether this is desirable.

  * Avoid links within links.

  * Added `escaper` to util; using this instead of gsub in xml writer.
    This gives a big speed boost (15-20%).

  * Improved handling of ins/del tags.

  * Added `hash_enumerators` option.

  * Added `require_blank_before_header`, `require_blank_before_blockquote`
    options.

  * Require newline after reference definition.

  * Added `make prof`, `make coverage`.

  * Cleaner treatment of `expandtabs`.

  * Use ropes instead of concatenating strings.  The advantage is not
    speed -- this is actually slower than the old version -- but flexibility.

    A rope (here) is an array containing strings, functions, and ropes.  At
    the end of parsing, the rope is walked and a string constructed by
    concatenating its elements in order.

    The functions are evaluated after parsing, and can access globals
    constructed during parsing, such as a list of references or footnotes.  So
    we no longer need to do two passes for things like this.  This will be
    really useful when we add things like citations.

    As a bonus, reference link definitions now work even in embedded contexts
    like block quotes.

  * Added map, intersperse, flatten to util

  * Cleaned up spacing in html lists.

  * Fixed typo in tex writer: `\ldots` for `\\ldots`.

  * Fixed bug in rockspec (`branch` -> `tag`).

  * man writer:  Fixed lists so we don't get `.PP` after `.IP`.

  * Change default of containers to + for docbook and dzslides.
